Sherlock Holmes received a note with some strange strings: `Let's date! 3485djDkxh4hhGE 2984akDfkkkkggEdsb s&hgsfdk d&Hyscvnm`. It took him only a minute to figure out that those strange strings are actually referring to the coded time `Thursday 14:04` -- since the first common capital English letter (case sensitive) shared by the first two strings is the 4th capital letter `D`, representing the 4th day in a week; the second common character is the 5th capital letter `E`, representing the 14th hour (hence the hours from 0 to 23 in a day are represented by the numbers from 0 to 9 and the capital letters from `A` to `N`, respectively); and the English letter shared by the last two strings is `s` at the 4th position, representing the 4th minute. Now given two pairs of strings, you are supposed to help Sherlock decode the dating time.

**Input Specification**

Each input file contains one test case. Each case gives 4 non-empty strings of no more than 60 characters without white space in 4 lines.

**Output Specification**

For each test case, print the decoded time in one line, in the format `DAY HH:MM`, where `DAY` is a 3-character abbreviation for the days in a week -- that is, `MON` for Monday, `TUE` for Tuesday, `WED` for Wednesday, `THU` for Thursday, `FRI` for Friday, `SAT` for Saturday, and `SUN` for Sunday. It is guaranteed that the result is unique for each case.
