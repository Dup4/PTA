A **clique** is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. A **maximal clique** is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex. (Quoted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory))

Now it is your job to judge if a given subset of vertices can form a maximal clique.

**Input Specification**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers Nv ($\le$ 200), the number of vertices in the graph, and Ne, the number of undirected edges. Then Ne lines follow, each gives a pair of vertices of an edge. The vertices are numbered from 1 to Nv.

After the graph, there is another positive integer M ($\le$ 100). Then M lines of query follow, each first gives a positive number K ($\le$ Nv), then followed by a sequence of K distinct vertices. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

**Output Specification**

For each of the M queries, print in a line `Yes` if the given subset of vertices can form a maximal clique; or if it is a clique but not a **maximal clique**, print `Not Maximal`; or if it is not a clique at all, print `Not a Clique`.
