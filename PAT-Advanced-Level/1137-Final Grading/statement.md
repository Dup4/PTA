For a student taking the online course "Data Structures" on China University MOOC (http://www.icourse163.org/), to be qualified for a certificate, he/she must first obtain no less than 200 points from the online programming assignments, and then receive a final grade no less than 60 out of 100. The final grade is calculated by $$G = (G_{mid-term}\times 40\% + G_{final}\times 60\%)$$ if $$G_{mid-term} > G_{final}$$, or $$G_{final}$$ will be taken as the final grade $$G$$. Here $$G_{mid-term}$$ and $$G_{final}$$ are the student's scores of the mid-term and the final exams, respectively.

The problem is that different exams have different grading sheets. Your job is to write a program to merge all the grading sheets into one.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives three positive integers: P , the number of students having done the online programming assignments; M, the number of students on the mid-term list; and N, the number of students on the final exam list. All the numbers are no more than 10,000.

Then three blocks follow. The first block contains P online programming scores $$G_p$$'s; the second one contains M mid-term scores $$G_{mid-term}$$'s; and the last one contains N final exam scores $$G_{final}$$'s. Each score occupies a line with the format: `StudentID Score`, where `StudentID` is a string of no more than 20 English letters and digits, and `Score` is a nonnegative integer (the maximum score of the online programming is 900, and that of the mid-term and final exams is 100).

### Output Specification:

For each case, print the list of students who are qualified for certificates. Each student occupies a line with the format:

`StudentID` $$G_p$$ $$G_{mid-term}$$ $$G_{final}$$ $$G$$

If some score does not exist, output "$$-1$$" instead. The output must be sorted in descending order of their final grades ($$G$$ must be rounded up to an integer). If there is a tie, output in ascending order of their `StudentID`'s. It is guaranteed that the `StudentID`'s are all distinct, and there is at least one qullified student.

### Sample Output:
