For two rational numbers, your task is to implement the basic arithmetics, that is, to calculate their sum, difference, product and quotient.

**Input Specification**

Each input file contains one test case, which gives in one line the two rational numbers in the format `a1/b1 a2/b2`. The numerators and the denominators are all in the range of long int. If there is a negative sign, it must appear only in front of the numerator. The denominators are guaranteed to be non-zero numbers.

**Output Specification**

For each test case, print in 4 lines the sum, difference, product and quotient of the two rational numbers, respectively. The format of each line is `number1 operator number2 = result`. Notice that all the rational numbers must be in their simplest form `k a/b`, where `k` is the integer part, and `a/b` is the simplest fraction part. If the number is negative, it must be included in a pair of parentheses. If the denominator in the division is zero, output `Inf` as the result. It is guaranteed that all the output integers are in the range of **long int**.

**Sample Input 1**
```plaintext
2/3 -4/2
```

**Sample Output 1**
```plaintext
2/3 + (-2) = (-1 1/3)
2/3 - (-2) = 2 2/3
2/3 * (-2) = (-1 1/3)
2/3 / (-2) = (-1/3)
```

**Sample Input 2**
```plaintext
5/3 0/6
```

**Sample Output 2**
```plaintext
1 2/3 + 0 = 1 2/3
1 2/3 - 0 = 1 2/3
1 2/3 * 0 = 0
1 2/3 / 0 = Inf
```
