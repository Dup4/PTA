If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough." Your job is to write a program to compute $$A+B$$ where $$A$$ and $$B$$ are given in the standard form of `Galleon.Sickle.Knut` (`Galleon` is an integer in [$$0, 10^7$$], `Sickle` is an integer in [0, 17), and `Knut` is an integer in [0, 29)).

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with $$A$$ and $$B$$ in the standard form, separated by one space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the sum of $$A$$ and $$B$$ in one line, with the same format as the input.

### Sample Input:
```plaintext
3.2.1 10.16.27
```

### Sample Output:
```plaintext
14.1.28
```
