Cutting an integer means to cut a K digits lone integer Z into two integers of (K/2) digits long integers A and B. For example, after cutting Z = 167334, we have A = 167 and B = 334. It is interesting to see that Z can be devided by the product of A and B, as 167334 / (167 $$\times$$ 334) = 3. Given an integer Z, you are supposed to test if it is such an integer.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N ($$\le$$ 20). Then N lines follow, each gives an integer Z (10 $$\le$$ Z $$<2^{31}$$). It is guaranteed that the number of digits of Z is an even number.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print a single line `Yes` if it is such a number, or `No` if not.
