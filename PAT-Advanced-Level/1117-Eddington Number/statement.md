British astronomer Eddington liked to ride a bike. It is said that in order to show off his skill, he has even defined an "Eddington number", $$E$$ -- that is, the maximum integer $$E$$ such that it is for $$E$$ days that one rides more than $$E$$ miles. Eddington's own $$E$$ was 87.

Now given everyday's distances that one rides for $$N$$ days, you are supposed to find the corresponding $$E$$ ($$\le N$$).

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer $$N$$ ($$\le 10^5$$), the days of continuous riding. Then $$N$$ non-negative integers are given in the next line, being the riding distances of everyday.

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in a line the Eddington number for these $$N$$ days.

### Sample Input:

```

### Sample Output:
```plaintext
